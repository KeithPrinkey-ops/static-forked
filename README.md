# ‚ö°Ô∏è Static - The Pure Power of Simplicity.

A static site gernator you're going to love. No more complicated configurations, bloated javascript frameworks, or feeling like you got kicked in the face by a horse!

- Static is **easy**. 
- HTML is **easy**. 
- But, somewhere along the way we lost **the simplicity** of building Static HTML websites

**Static** brings the *power of simplicity* back into static site generators.

## Five compelling reasons this might just be your jam! (stack üòè)

### 1. Page-based Routing

Each file within the pages directory corresponds to a route on your website. With a structure like this:

```
pages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contact
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ form
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
```

Your new site will have the following routes available:

```
http://localhost:3000
http://localhost:3000/about
http://localhost:3000/contact
http://localhost:3000/contact/form
```

Adding a new route is as straightforward as adding a new file or folder to the `pages` directory.

### 2. Layouts

Design **layouts** that multiple pages can utilize.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>{title}</title>
</head>
<body>
    {slot}
</body>
</html>
```

Then, use it in any page.

```
<layout title="Radical Righteousness" src="main.html">

    <h1>üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Totally Tubuloso Website</h1>
    
</layout>
```
### 3. Includes

Creating re-usable HTML partials is simple with the `<include>` tag. This allows you to insert sections of HTML stored in separate files, making your codebase more organized and modular.

Specify the HTML file you want to include with the `src` attribute.

```
<layout title="Behind the Scenes!" src="main.html">

    <include src="about-header.html"></include>
    <include src="about-copy.html"></include>

</layout>
```

By utilizing these includes, you can easily embed common sections like headers, footers, or other repetitive elements across different pages.

#### 4. TailwindCSS Integration

Add the TailwindCSS **shortcode** to the `<head>` of any layout and it will automatically be injected. Example:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>{title}</title>
    {tailwindcss}
</head>
<body>
    {slot}
</body>
</html>
```

The development server will replace `{tailwindcss}` with the TailwindCSS CDN link. During build, the Tailwind CLI is used to compile only the classes you used in your project to a minified file. The `<link>` tag containing this new CSS file will added to the `<head>` of each page.

```
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="_site/assets/css/main.css">
</head>
```

#### 5. Collections

You'll also be able to add collections of data to your application.

***collections/menu.json**

```
[
    {
        "title" : "Home",
        "link" : "/"
    },
    {
        "title" : "About",
        "link" : "/about"
    }
]
```

Now, you can loop through a collection in any page, layout, or include:

```
<ForEach collection="menu">
    <li>{menu.title}</h1>
</ForEach>
```

# How To Setup

```
npm install -g @devdojo/static
```

Now you'll have the CLI tool `static` installed on your machine which will allow you to run these commands:

- **static new folder-name** - Create a new website with the static starter template
- **static dev** - Serve up a development version of your static website
- **static build** - Build a production ready version of your website (available in the _site directory)

Now that you have the `static` cli command installed we can get started by creating your new static website.

## Pages

### using the static new folder-name command

Static uses a simple page-based routing system where each route is mapped to a file inside of the `pages` directory. You can either get started by running the `static new folder-name` command, or you can get started by creating a new `pages` directory in an empty folder.

Here is an example of how the page-based routing works:

- `pages/index.html` -> `http://localhost:3000`
- `pages/about.html` -> `http://localhost:3000/about`
- `pages/contact/index.html` -> `http://localhost:3000/contact`

Running `static dev` inside of your project folder will serve up your website on `http://localhost:3000`. Running `static build` will compile a minified version of your website inside of the `_site` folder.


All the content for the website will live inside of the `/src` folder. Inside this folder you will find a few other folders:

- pages
- layouts
- includes
- assets

# pages

Creating new pages is as easy as adding a new file or folder to the `pages` directory. If you add a file located at `pages/index.html` this will be the homepage of your application.

There are two ways to create a route for the website, which include adding an `index.html` file to a folder, (for instance, adding a file located at `/pages/about/index.html` would serve up an `/about` page). You could also add this to the main `pages` directory like so `pages/about.html` and it would resolve to the `/about` page.

# layouts

The layouts directory contain all the HTML layouts that can be used for any of your pages. Any `.html` page file can inherit from a layout. Here is an example homepage `pages/index.html`:


```html
<layout title="This is the title of the page" src="main.html">

    Content for your page here
    
</layout>
```

As you'll see you can use the `<layout></layout>` tags to create a page and put the content for the page inside of those tags. The **layout** tag contains two attributes:

- **title** - The title for that specific page
- **src** - The src for the layout file that you want to use

Here is an example layout file:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>{title}</title>
    <style>[x-cloak]{ display:none; }</style>
    {tailwindcss}
</head>
<body>
    {slot}
    <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

The content that you put inside the `<layout></layout>` tags will be rendered at the location of the `{slot}` shortcode. Inside of the **layout** tag can include any kind of HTML, like so:

```html
<layout title="This is the title of the page" src="main.html">

    <p>This will be rendered in place of the {slot} text</p>
    
</layout>
```

This is great, but what if we wanted to re-use multiple HTML code inside of a page. In that case we can make use of **includes**, let's talk about includes next.

# includes

The **includes** directory can contain partials of HTML snippets that you may want to re-use throughout your site. This can include navigations, footers, hero sections, and more.

Inludes are nothing more than HTML snippets, here is an example of an include located at `includes/message.html`:

```
<p>This is just a simple message snippet that can be re-used inside of any page</p>
```

Then, if you wanted to include this inside of a page, you can simple use the `<include></include>` tags, like so:

```html
<layout title="This is the title of the page" src="main.html">

    <include src="message.html"></include>
    
</layout>
```

Now, when this page is rendered you will have the following output:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>{title}</title>
    <style>[x-cloak]{ display:none; }</style>
    {tailwindcss}
</head>
<body>
    <p>This is just a simple message snippet that can be re-used inside of any page</p>
    <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

> Notice the {tailwindcss}, this will inject Tailwind in the website and render the minified TailwindCSS in the final build.

# assets

Finally, you'll notice the **assets** folder, this is where we render the `main` assets for our website, which include:

- **assets/css/main.css**
- **assets/js/main.js**

You can add any custom CSS or custom Javascript in those files and they will be rendered in dev mode and shown on the page, or they will be minified and published to the `build` directory upon build.
